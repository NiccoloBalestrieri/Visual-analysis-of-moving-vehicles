# Visual-analysis-of-moving-vehicles

This project was developed as part of the Image Analysis and Computer Vision course at Politecnico di Milano. The goal is to analyze and reconstruct the road profile using a single calibrated static camera to identify and track moving vehicles, specifically focusing on the visible wheels.

## Project Overview
The project involves:
- **Region Proposal Network (RPN):** An object detection network trained to detect car wheels.
- **Ellipse Detection Algorithm:** Designed to detect ellipses corresponding to the visible wheels within the proposed regions.
- **3D Point Cloud Estimation:** Estimating the 3D points on the road and interpolating the local surface.

## Motivation
The advantages of this project include:
- Reducing system cost and complexity by using a single static camera.
- Enhancing accuracy in wheel localization through deep learning techniques.
- Providing valuable data for infrastructure maintenance and urban planning.

## Methods and Techniques

### Camera Calibration
The camera was calibrated using the Zhang method, which involves:
- Capturing multiple images of a planar calibration pattern.
- Detecting feature points (e.g., corners of the checkerboard) in the images.
- Computing homographies and intrinsic camera parameters.

### Data Collection
Videos of cars were recorded under various conditions:
- Cars making large and sharp curves.
- Cars on straight roads.
- Cars going uphill.

### Network Architectures

#### ResNet50
- Pre-trained on the COCO 2017 dataset.
- Fine-tuned for wheel detection using annotated images of cars.

#### YOLOv5
- Real-time detection and classification model.
- Pre-trained on a diverse set of car images covering various orientations and lighting conditions.

### Wheels Detection
An ellipse detection algorithm was designed to select the most probable ellipses corresponding to the wheels, improving upon simple bounding box detection.

### 3D Reconstruction
Two approaches were explored:
- **Deep Learning-based Depth Estimation:** Using a Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) model to infer depth maps from single images.
- **Geometric Approach (PnP):** Recovering extrinsic parameters from correspondences between image points and world points using a 3D wheel model.

## Results
The deep learning approach provided better 3D point cloud estimation compared to the geometric approach. Qualitative analysis of the results showed satisfactory alignment with real-world conditions.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a single static camera for 3D road reconstruction and vehicle localization. Future work could explore further improvements in the geometric approach and incorporate additional car features for enhanced accuracy.
